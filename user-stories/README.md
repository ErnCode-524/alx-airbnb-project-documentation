# ðŸ“˜ User Stories

This directory contains the user stories for the Airbnb Clone project. Each user story describes a key interaction or feature from the system, helping to guide development based on real user needs. These stories are derived from the use case diagram and serve as a foundation for implementing core backend functionalities such as authentication, property management, bookings, payments, messaging, and more.
