### Use Case Diagram for Airbnb Clone Backend

The following use case diagram outlines the key functionalities of the **Airbnb Clone** backend system. It visualizes how different actors—**Guests**, **Hosts**, and **Admins**—interact with the core system components. These components include user authentication, property management, booking system, payment processing, messaging, notifications, and reviews.

- **Guests** can register/login, manage their profiles, search for properties, book stays, make payments, message hosts, receive notifications, and leave reviews for properties they have stayed in.
- **Hosts** can register/login, manage their profiles, add/edit/delete properties, manage bookings, receive payments, message guests, receive notifications, and respond to reviews.
- **Admins** can access the admin dashboard for overseeing and managing the overall system.

The use case diagram illustrates how each actor engages with these features to ensure seamless operation of the platform.
